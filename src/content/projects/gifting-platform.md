# Online Gifting Platform

## The Problem

Gift-giving can be impersonal and inefficient. People often resort to generic gifts that don't reflect the recipient's interests, and physical gifts frequently go unused or are discarded. Meanwhile, local businesses struggle to reach new customers outside their immediate network.

## The Solution

I'm building a platform that connects gift-givers with curated local experiences and products. Rather than buying another generic item, users can gift memorable experiences from local merchants, with flexible redemption options for recipients.

## Current Status

The project is in MVP stage with these features implemented:
- User authentication and profiles
- Merchant onboarding and inventory management
- Gift selection and checkout process
- Recipient notification and redemption system
- Basic analytics for merchants

## Technical Implementation

The platform uses:
- **Next.js** for the frontend, with server components for SEO optimization
- **Node.js** backend API for business logic
- **PostgreSQL** database with a relational model for orders, gifts, and redemptions
- **Stripe** for payment processing, including scheduled payments
- **SendGrid** for transactional emails

## Challenges & Learnings

### Two-sided Marketplace Dynamics

Building a platform that serves both gift-givers and merchants has been challenging. Each side has different needs, expectations, and incentives:

- **Cold Start Problem**: Needed to attract both merchants and customers simultaneously
- **Value Proposition**: Different messaging required for each user type
- **User Experience**: Balancing merchant needs with customer simplicity

### Payment Flow Complexity

Gift transactions are complex because they involve:
- A purchaser who pays
- A recipient who redeems
- A merchant who fulfills
- Platform fees and payment timing

Setting up this flow in Stripe required careful planning and testing.

### Current Challenges

I'm currently working through these issues:
1. Scaling the merchant onboarding process
2. Improving the redemption experience for recipients
3. Developing a sustainable fee structure

## Next Steps

My immediate priorities are:
- Adding a recommendation engine for better gift matching
- Implementing a mobile app for redemption
- Expanding merchant tools for inventory management
- Testing different marketing channels for customer acquisition

## Early Lessons

The biggest lessons so far:
- **Start smaller**: I initially tried to build too many features
- **Talk to users earlier**: Some assumptions about gift-givers' preferences were incorrect
- **Focus on one side first**: Should have established the merchant base before pursuing gift-givers
